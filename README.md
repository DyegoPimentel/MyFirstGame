For the development of the game,  I used Python and pygame library, the game is a contemporary version of the classic Pac-Man game.

In this project I was responsible for all stages of development:
- Brainstorm
- Logo Design
- User Interface
- Game Development


**To play is very simple, just follow the steps below:**
- Have Python installed;
- Install the Pygame library (pip install pygame);
- Clone this repository;
- Access the cloned repository on your computer;
- Open the terminal and type (python main.py);
- On the home screen just press the spacebar to start the game;
- On the game screen, Pac-Man is fixed on the Y axis, and to move to
right or left on the X axis, just use the arrow keys.


**About the game**

The objective is to collect as many points as possible, always remembering to dodge the little ghosts.
so that Pacman lives on. The game speeds up every 100 points collected in order to make it difficult to
game, and if you land on the game over screen, just press space to restart.
